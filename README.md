## Basic Calculator

### Objective

In this project, you will use classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. The calculator will be able to:

- Add two integers
- Subtract two integers
- Multiply two integers
- Divide two integers
- Apply the modulo operator on two integers

### Instructions

1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
2. Define the main method in a class to execute the calculator.
3. Create an instance of the Calculator class.
4. Use the calculator's methods to perform arithmetic calculations on two integers.
5. Display the results of the calculations.

### Calculator Class

The Calculator class contains methods for each arithmetic operation. Here's an overview of the available methods:

- `add(int a, int b)`: Adds two integers and returns the result.
- `subtract(int a, int b)`: Subtracts the second integer from the first integer and returns the result.
- `multiply(int a, int b)`: Multiplies two integers and returns the result.
- `divide(int a, int b)`: Divides the first integer by the second integer and returns the result.
- `modulo(int a, int b)`: Computes the remainder when the first integer is divided by the second integer and returns the result.
